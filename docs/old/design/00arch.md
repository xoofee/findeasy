design a backend for a frontend app. the app could get user's gps location and floor level and ask the server to respond a map of the underground parking lot map (a zip file) in the building. the building is calculated from the gps location provided by the user. the server maintain a list of builds, each with a gps location. the backend may support tens of thousands of different buildings in many cities



Designing a backend system to serve a frontend app that provides users with underground parking lot maps based on their GPS location involves several key components. Here's an architecture and design for such a system:

### **Key Requirements:**
1. **User sends GPS coordinates and floor level**.
2. **Backend calculates the closest building** based on the provided GPS location.
3. **Backend responds with a map (ZIP file)** of the underground parking lot for the relevant floor.
4. **The system should support tens of thousands of buildings in multiple cities**.

### **System Components and Architecture:**

---

### **1. API Layer (Frontend ↔ Backend Communication)**

The frontend will make requests to the backend API, which will be responsible for:

- **Receiving the GPS coordinates and floor level**.
- **Querying the appropriate building based on location**.
- **Serving the parking lot map** (ZIP file) for the relevant floor.

#### Example API Endpoints:
- **POST `/api/v1/get_parking_map`**:
  - **Request**: Contains GPS coordinates (`lat`, `long`) and `floor level`.
  - **Response**: A URL to the ZIP file containing the parking lot map or a direct download.

**Example request payload**:
```json
{
  "latitude": 37.7749,
  "longitude": -122.4194,
  "floor_level": 2
}
```

**Example response payload**:
```json
{
  "map_url": "https://example.com/maps/building123/floor2.zip"
}
```

### **2. Backend Logic**

The backend will consist of several modules:

#### **2.1. Building Location Database**
A key component of the backend is the **building location database**, which stores information about the buildings, their GPS coordinates, and other metadata (such as parking lot floors, building names, and available zip files).

##### **Data Model**:
- **Building**: 
  - `id` (unique identifier)
  - `name` (building name)
  - `latitude` (GPS latitude)
  - `longitude` (GPS longitude)
  - `floors` (list of available parking lot floor levels)
  - `parking_map_urls` (mapping of floor levels to ZIP files)

Example data:
```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "Building A",
  "latitude": 37.7749,
  "longitude": -122.4194,
  "floors": [1, 2, 3],
  "parking_map_urls": {
    "1": "https://example.com/maps/building123/floor1.zip",
    "2": "https://example.com/maps/building123/floor2.zip",
    "3": "https://example.com/maps/building123/floor3.zip"
  }
}
```

#### **2.2. Geospatial Search and Location Matching**

To find the closest building based on the user’s GPS coordinates, we can leverage **geospatial indexing**. Here's how:

- **Use a spatial index**: Tools like **PostgreSQL with PostGIS** or **MongoDB with geospatial queries** allow us to store GPS coordinates and perform distance calculations efficiently. For example, the Haversine formula can be used to calculate the distance between two GPS points.

##### **Steps**:
1. **User provides GPS coordinates**.
2. **Query the database** for the nearest building to those coordinates, using geospatial queries.
3. **Return the nearest building**.

#### **2.3. ZIP File Management**

For each building, the server needs to provide ZIP files of the underground parking lot maps for different floors. These files can be stored in a cloud storage service (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) for easy access and scalability.

- **ZIP files** for each floor should be pre-generated and stored in the cloud.
- When the backend identifies the nearest building and the correct floor, it will generate a URL pointing to the relevant map ZIP file.

#### **2.4. Caching and Optimization**

To handle the load of tens of thousands of buildings across many cities efficiently, the backend should incorporate caching strategies:

- **Caching building data** (e.g., with Redis) to reduce frequent database queries when retrieving the closest building.
- **CDN (Content Delivery Network)** to serve the ZIP files faster to users, ensuring low-latency access.

#### **2.5. Handling Scale (Multiple Cities and Tens of Thousands of Buildings)**

- **Sharded databases**: Use database partitioning (sharding) to split building data by city or region to improve query performance and scalability.
- **Multi-region deployment**: Deploy servers in multiple regions (e.g., AWS regions) to ensure low latency and high availability.

### **3. Detailed Flow for Request Handling**

Let's walk through a detailed flow of handling a user request:

1. **User Request**:
   - The frontend app collects the user’s GPS coordinates and floor level.
   - It sends a **POST request** to the backend API with these details.

2. **Backend Processing**:
   - **Geospatial Search**: The backend receives the coordinates and queries the **building location database** using geospatial indexing (e.g., PostGIS) to find the closest building.
   - **Find Floor Map**: Once the closest building is identified, the backend checks if the requested floor exists for that building. If it does, the backend retrieves the URL of the ZIP file for the parking lot map from cloud storage (S3, etc.).

3. **Response**:
   - If the map is found, the backend sends back the URL for the ZIP file. If not, it sends an error response with a suitable message.

### **4. Database and Infrastructure Considerations**

#### **Database Choice**:
- **Relational Database (PostgreSQL with PostGIS)**: 
  - Great for geospatial queries and relational data.
  - Supports spatial indexes and distance calculations.
  
- **NoSQL Database (MongoDB with Geospatial Indexing)**:
  - Alternative to relational databases for unstructured data and high scalability.
  - Supports geospatial queries.

#### **Storage**:
- **Cloud Storage (AWS S3 / Google Cloud Storage)**:
  - Store ZIP files of the parking lot maps.
  - Ensure fast and reliable access to maps across regions.

#### **Caching**:
- Use **Redis** or **Memcached** for caching geospatial queries and building data to improve response times.
- Cache the URLs of the most frequently requested maps to reduce database load.

#### **Scaling**:
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Use load balancers to distribute traffic across multiple backend instances.
- **Auto-Scaling**: Configure auto-scaling groups based on demand to handle spikes in user requests.

#### **CDN (Content Delivery Network)**:
- Use a CDN (e.g., **CloudFront**, **Cloudflare**) for serving ZIP files to users, ensuring fast, low-latency access regardless of the user's location.

### **5. Security**

Ensure that the backend is secure by:
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement proper user authentication (e.g., OAuth, JWT) if needed.
- **Rate Limiting**: Protect the API from abuse with rate limiting and throttling.
- **Access Control**: Ensure only authorized users can access certain building maps if required.
- **Secure File Hosting**: Use signed URLs or token-based authentication for accessing the ZIP files on cloud storage.
