## is there any dart/flutter package that is capable of
1 manage maps (like parking area). there are many parking lots in different buildings in different cities.
2 provide tools to create and modify maps
3 provide algorithm for path finding
4 provide seamless conversion between map and graph, so that the path finding and path visualization is convenient
4 provide path visualization

In the Dart/Flutter ecosystem, there are several packages and tools that can be used to manage maps, create and modify them, implement pathfinding algorithms, and provide path visualization. While there isn't a single package that combines *all* these features seamlessly, you can combine a few packages to meet your needs. Here's a breakdown:

### 1. **Managing Maps (Parking Areas, Multiple Locations)**

For managing maps and geographic data, you'll need a package that allows you to display maps, store location data, and potentially integrate with a backend or GIS (Geographical Information System).

- **[flutter_map](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_map)**  
  This package is a popular Flutter wrapper around Leaflet, which is a powerful JavaScript library for interactive maps. You can use it to display maps, including custom overlays and markers for different parking lots across cities. It's highly customizable and can integrate with other libraries for data management.

- **[google_maps_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/google_maps_flutter)**  
  If you want to use Google Maps in your Flutter app, this package provides integration with Google Maps, allowing you to display locations such as parking lots, building entrances, etc. It supports placing custom markers for each parking area and provides geolocation services.

- **[mapbox_gl](https://pub.dev/packages/mapbox_gl)**  
  Another good option for managing maps is **Mapbox**, which provides detailed map rendering with support for custom styles, markers, and overlays. This is ideal if you're managing large parking areas across cities and want to visualize them interactively.

### 2. **Tools to Create and Modify Maps**

While Flutter doesn't have a direct solution for **creating and modifying maps** in the sense of editing GIS data, you can integrate tools for managing the data outside Flutter and visualize the results inside the app.

- **QGIS** (for desktop, outside Flutter):  
  If you need to modify map data (e.g., parking lot boundaries), QGIS is a great open-source tool to edit, visualize, and export geographic data (as GeoJSON or shapefiles) that you can then display in your Flutter app using **flutter_map** or **google_maps_flutter**.

- **GeoJSON**:  
  Both **flutter_map** and **google_maps_flutter** support GeoJSON files, which is a popular format for storing geographic data. You can create or modify maps with tools like **QGIS**, export the data to GeoJSON, and load it into your Flutter app to manage and display parking areas.

### 3. **Pathfinding Algorithm**

For pathfinding algorithms, Flutter does not have a dedicated package, but you can implement algorithms like **A\* (A-star)**, **Dijkstra**, or **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** in Dart. Some packages can help with graph-based algorithms or network routing:

- **[flutter_path_finder](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_path_finder)**:  
  This is a simple package for finding paths on a 2D grid, which could work if your parking lots are laid out as a grid or matrix. It supports pathfinding with the A* algorithm and can help you calculate the shortest path between two points.

- **Dart's built-in data structures**:  
  You can also implement more complex pathfinding algorithms manually by working with **graphs** (nodes and edges) in Dart, using built-in libraries like **dart:collection**.

- **[graphlib.dart](https://pub.dev/packages/graphlib.dart)**:  
  A Dart library for working with graphs. It can be useful for representing parking areas as a graph (nodes = areas, edges = paths between areas), and you can use it alongside your pathfinding algorithm.

### 4. **Seamless Conversion Between Map and Graph (Pathfinding + Map)**

- **GeoJSON to Graph Conversion**:  
  If you have parking areas stored as **GeoJSON** files, you can convert this data into a graph format (nodes = parking spots, edges = paths between spots). You can use a Dart package to parse the GeoJSON and create a graph representation of the map, making pathfinding easier.

- **Dart Graph Libraries**:  
  You can convert your map to a graph representation using libraries like **graphlib.dart** or custom logic to create a graph from the layout of your parking areas.

### 5. **Path Visualization**

Once you have computed the pathfinding algorithm, you’ll want to visualize the paths on the map. For path visualization in Flutter, you can:

- **flutter_map**:  
  After computing the shortest path, you can overlay the path on a map as a series of **Polyline** markers or use **polyline** objects to draw the path on the map.

- **google_maps_flutter**:  
  Google Maps Flutter also supports adding **polylines** to your maps, which can be used to visualize paths after calculating them.

### Putting it All Together

Here’s how you might combine these packages to achieve your goals:

1. **Use `flutter_map`** (or `google_maps_flutter`) to display maps and parking areas with custom markers.
2. **Create or modify maps using QGIS**, then export the data to **GeoJSON** format.
3. **Parse the GeoJSON data** in Flutter and convert it into a graph representation (nodes for parking spots, edges for paths between them).
4. **Use a pathfinding algorithm** like **A\* or Dijkstra** to compute the shortest path between two parking spots.
5. **Visualize the computed path** on the map by drawing a **polyline**.

### Example Workflow:
1. Use **QGIS** to create your parking lot maps and export them as **GeoJSON**.
2. Load the **GeoJSON** into your Flutter app using **flutter_map** or **google_maps_flutter**.
3. Convert the GeoJSON data to a **graph** (using **graphlib.dart** or custom Dart code).
4. Implement a pathfinding algorithm like **A\*** or **Dijkstra** to calculate the shortest path on the graph.
5. Draw the path on the map using **flutter_map**'s **Polyline** or **google_maps_flutter**'s **Polylines**.

### Conclusion

Although there isn't a single package that combines all of the features you're looking for in Flutter, by combining packages like **flutter_map**, **google_maps_flutter**, **graphlib.dart**, and implementing your own pathfinding algorithms, you can create a solution that allows you to manage, modify, and visualize parking areas, as well as implement efficient pathfinding.

## how to make a customized parking map indoor? and make a route plan between the parking position (say C219) to the elevator. give a concrete example using dart/flutter


To create a customized indoor parking map and make a route plan from a parking position (like "C219") to the elevator using Flutter and Dart, you will need to utilize several key components, including:

1. **Map Visualization** – This can be done using `Flutter`'s built-in `CustomPainter` or a third-party package like `flutter_map` or `google_maps_flutter` (for more advanced maps, e.g., for floors of a building).
2. **Route Calculation** – To determine the route between C219 and the elevator, you can simulate a pathfinding algorithm like A* or Dijkstra, or simply use predefined paths if the map is not complex.
3. **User Interface (UI)** – Display the map and route plan clearly on the screen.

### Step-by-Step Approach

#### 1. **Set Up Your Flutter Project**

If you haven't already, start a new Flutter project:

```bash
flutter create parking_route_app
cd parking_route_app
```

Install any dependencies you might need. For map visualizations, you can use `flutter_map` (for custom maps) or `google_maps_flutter` (for outdoor maps).

For this example, let's use `flutter_map` to draw a custom indoor map.

Add this dependency in your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_map: ^0.14.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the dependencies.

#### 2. **Design Your Indoor Map Layout**

Assuming you are building a static map (a floorplan of the parking area), you can use `flutter_map`'s `ImageLayer` to load the floor plan of your parking lot. Alternatively, you could use `CustomPainter` if you want more control over drawing shapes like parking spots and paths.

Here’s how to set up the floor plan:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_map/flutter_map.dart';
import 'package:latlong2/latlong.dart';

void main() => runApp(MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Indoor Parking Map',
      home: ParkingMap(),
    );
  }
}

class ParkingMap extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Indoor Parking Map'),
      ),
      body: FlutterMap(
        options: MapOptions(
          center: LatLng(0, 0),  // Set center of your map
          zoom: 16.0,
        ),
        layers: [
          TileLayerOptions(
            urlTemplate: 'https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png',
            subdomains: ['a', 'b', 'c'],
          ),
          ImageLayerOptions(
            image: AssetImage('assets/parking_floor_plan.png'),  // Your floor plan image
            bounds: LatLngBounds(
              LatLng(0.0, 0.0),   // Bottom left corner
              LatLng(10.0, 10.0),  // Top right corner
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Here, you would replace `'assets/parking_floor_plan.png'` with the actual path to your parking floor plan image. The `LatLngBounds` defines the bounds of your map (you can adjust these to match your floor plan).

#### 3. **Define Parking Spot Locations**

Now, let’s define the coordinates for specific parking spots, including C219, and plot them on the map. You could also add custom markers for these spots:

```dart
class ParkingMap extends StatelessWidget {
  final List<LatLng> parkingSpots = [
    LatLng(3.0, 4.0), // Example coordinates for C219
    LatLng(3.0, 5.0), // Another parking spot
    // Add other spots as needed
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Indoor Parking Map'),
      ),
      body: FlutterMap(
        options: MapOptions(
          center: LatLng(3.0, 4.0),  // Start at C219
          zoom: 18.0,
        ),
        layers: [
          TileLayerOptions(
            urlTemplate: 'https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png',
            subdomains: ['a', 'b', 'c'],
          ),
          ImageLayerOptions(
            image: AssetImage('assets/parking_floor_plan.png'),
            bounds: LatLngBounds(
              LatLng(0.0, 0.0),
              LatLng(10.0, 10.0),
            ),
          ),
          MarkerLayerOptions(
            markers: parkingSpots.map((spot) {
              return Marker(
                point: spot,
                builder: (ctx) => Icon(
                  Icons.local_parking,
                  size: 30.0,
                  color: Colors.blue,
                ),
              );
            }).toList(),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code shows how to place markers on the parking spots. `parkingSpots` is a list of coordinates (using `LatLng`) that represent parking spots.

#### 4. **Add Route Between Parking Spot (C219) and Elevator**

Next, you need to calculate a route from a specific parking spot (C219) to the elevator. If the layout is simple and static, you can manually define a route or use a pathfinding algorithm for more complex maps.

To keep it simple, let’s assume we know the path from C219 to the elevator. You can visualize it by drawing a line from C219 to the elevator’s location using `PolylineLayerOptions` in Flutter.

Here’s how you might implement that:

```dart
class ParkingMap extends StatelessWidget {
  final LatLng elevatorLocation = LatLng(3.0, 6.0); // Elevator location
  final LatLng c219Location = LatLng(3.0, 4.0); // C219 parking spot

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Indoor Parking Map'),
      ),
      body: FlutterMap(
        options: MapOptions(
          center: c219Location,  // Start at C219
          zoom: 18.0,
        ),
        layers: [
          TileLayerOptions(
            urlTemplate: 'https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png',
            subdomains: ['a', 'b', 'c'],
          ),
          ImageLayerOptions(
            image: AssetImage('assets/parking_floor_plan.png'),
            bounds: LatLngBounds(
              LatLng(0.0, 0.0),
              LatLng(10.0, 10.0),
            ),
          ),
          MarkerLayerOptions(
            markers: [
              Marker(
                point: c219Location,
                builder: (ctx) => Icon(
                  Icons.local_parking,
                  size: 30.0,
                  color: Colors.blue,
                ),
              ),
              Marker(
                point: elevatorLocation,
                builder: (ctx) => Icon(
                  Icons.elevator,
                  size: 30.0,
                  color: Colors.red,
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
          PolylineLayerOptions(
            polylines: [
              Polyline(
                points: [c219Location, elevatorLocation],  // Route path from C219 to elevator
                strokeWidth: 4.0,
                color: Colors.green,
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example:

- The `c219Location` is the starting point (C219 parking spot).
- The `elevatorLocation` is where the elevator is located.
- The `PolylineLayerOptions` draws a green line between C219 and the elevator, representing the route.

#### 5. **Pathfinding Algorithm (Optional)**

If the map is more complex and involves multiple paths and obstacles, you can implement a pathfinding algorithm like A* or Dijkstra to calculate the optimal route. However, this is more advanced and would require representing the map as a graph of nodes and edges.

For simple cases, manually defining the route between C219 and the elevator (as shown above) is sufficient.

### 6. **Testing and Refining the Map**

Finally, test the map on your emulator or device. Make sure that the parking spot markers, the route line, and the elevator are placed correctly. You may need to adjust the zoom level and the position of markers depending on the scale of your map.

### Conclusion

This Flutter and Dart implementation uses `flutter_map` to display a customized indoor parking map and draw a route from a specific parking spot (C219) to the elevator. For simple scenarios, manually defining the route works well, while for more complex maps, you can implement pathfinding algorithms to calculate routes dynamically.

## does flutter_map have self-contained  Pathfinding Algorithm?


No, `flutter_map` does **not** come with a built-in pathfinding algorithm. It is primarily a mapping library designed for displaying and interacting with maps, such as showing tiles, markers, and polylines. It does not include features for pathfinding or routing, which are more complex algorithms needed for determining optimal routes between points.

However, you can **integrate pathfinding algorithms** yourself, such as **A* (A-star)** or **Dijkstra's algorithm**, into your Flutter app. These algorithms are commonly used to find the shortest path in a graph (such as a grid or a network of nodes).

If you're trying to find a route between two points (like from a parking spot to an elevator) on an indoor map, you'll need to:

1. **Model the parking map** as a graph or grid of connected nodes.
2. **Apply a pathfinding algorithm** (like A* or Dijkstra) to compute the optimal route between your start and end points.
3. **Render the route** using `flutter_map`'s polyline drawing capabilities (as shown in my previous example).

### Steps to Integrate a Pathfinding Algorithm

To implement a pathfinding algorithm like **A*** or **Dijkstra** into your Flutter project, follow these steps:

### 1. **Model the Parking Area as a Grid or Graph**

A parking area can be thought of as a **grid** or **graph** where each cell (or node) represents a possible position (a parking spot, aisle, or part of the path). Nodes are connected if there is a direct path between them, such as a walkable aisle or corridor.

For example, assume that:

- Each parking spot and aisle is a node.
- Nodes are connected if they are adjacent to each other (vertically or horizontally).

### 2. **Implementing a Pathfinding Algorithm**

You can write a simple **A*** algorithm (or Dijkstra’s algorithm) to calculate the shortest path from a start node (e.g., parking spot "C219") to an end node (e.g., the elevator).

Here is a very basic implementation of the **A*** algorithm in Dart:

```dart
import 'dart:collection';

class Node {
  final int x, y;
  double gCost = 0;  // Distance from the start node
  double hCost = 0;  // Heuristic (estimated cost to the end node)
  double fCost = 0;  // fCost = gCost + hCost
  Node? parent;

  Node(this.x, this.y);

  // Heuristic: Manhattan distance to the end point
  double get heuristic => (x - target.x).abs() + (y - target.y).abs();

  @override
  bool operator ==(Object other) =>
      other is Node && other.x == x && other.y == y;

  @override
  int get hashCode => x.hashCode ^ y.hashCode;
}

List<Node> aStar(List<List<Node>> grid, Node start, Node end) {
  // Open list (priority queue)
  var openList = PriorityQueue<Node>((a, b) => a.fCost.compareTo(b.fCost));
  openList.add(start);

  // Closed list (visited nodes)
  Set<Node> closedList = {};

  while (openList.isNotEmpty) {
    Node current = openList.removeFirst();

    // If we reach the destination node
    if (current == end) {
      List<Node> path = [];
      while (current.parent != null) {
        path.add(current);
        current = current.parent!;
      }
      path.add(start);
      return path.reversed.toList();
    }

    closedList.add(current);

    // Check all neighbors (up, down, left, right)
    List<Node> neighbors = [
      Node(current.x + 1, current.y),
      Node(current.x - 1, current.y),
      Node(current.x, current.y + 1),
      Node(current.x, current.y - 1)
    ];

    for (Node neighbor in neighbors) {
      if (closedList.contains(neighbor)) continue;

      double tentativeGCost = current.gCost + 1;  // Assuming uniform cost
      if (openList.contains(neighbor) && tentativeGCost >= neighbor.gCost) {
        continue;
      }

      neighbor.gCost = tentativeGCost;
      neighbor.hCost = (neighbor.x - end.x).abs() + (neighbor.y - end.y).abs();
      neighbor.fCost = neighbor.gCost + neighbor.hCost;
      neighbor.parent = current;

      if (!openList.contains(neighbor)) {
        openList.add(neighbor);
      }
    }
  }

  return [];
}

class PriorityQueue<T> extends SplayTreeSet<T> {
  PriorityQueue(Comparator<T> comparator) : super(comparator);
}
```

This is a simple implementation of **A***, where:

- The `Node` class represents each point in the grid (such as a parking spot or aisle).
- The algorithm searches for the shortest path by evaluating neighbors (adjacent nodes) and selecting the one that minimizes the cost (distance).
- `fCost` is the sum of `gCost` (distance from the start) and `hCost` (heuristic, estimated distance to the target).
  
### 3. **Visualizing the Route**

Once you have the path, you can visualize it on the map by plotting a polyline between the nodes that form the path.

For example, after calculating the shortest path (which would be a list of `Node` objects), you can convert these nodes into coordinates (LatLng) and display them using `PolylineLayerOptions` in `flutter_map`:

```dart
List<LatLng> pathToLatLng(List<Node> path) {
  return path.map((node) => LatLng(node.y.toDouble(), node.x.toDouble())).toList();
}

// Assuming path is the result from aStar
List<Node> path = aStar(grid, start, end);

// Convert to LatLng
List<LatLng> route = pathToLatLng(path);

// Now, render the route on your map
FlutterMap(
  options: MapOptions(
    center: LatLng(3.0, 4.0),
    zoom: 16.0,
  ),
  layers: [
    PolylineLayerOptions(
      polylines: [
        Polyline(
          points: route,
          strokeWidth: 4.0,
          color: Colors.green,
        ),
      ],
    ),
  ],
)
```

In this code:

- `pathToLatLng` converts the calculated path (a list of `Node` objects) into a list of `LatLng` coordinates that can be plotted on the map.
- The `PolylineLayerOptions` renders the path on the map as a green line.

### 4. **Improving the Pathfinding Algorithm**

For a more advanced solution, you can:

- **Use a graph model** for your parking lot layout (e.g., considering walls, ramps, etc.).
- Implement **Diagonals** (if applicable) in your pathfinding to allow for diagonal movement.
- Consider adding **obstacles** to the grid (e.g., walls, columns) where movement is not allowed.

### 5. **Alternatives**

If you're not keen on writing your own pathfinding algorithm, you can:

- Use **third-party Dart packages** such as `graphlib` for graph-related operations, which can help in creating the graph structure.
- Use **external APIs** or services (like Google Maps API for route planning) to handle the complex routing logic, and just visualize the result in your app using Flutter.

### Conclusion

In summary, **flutter_map** does not provide a pathfinding algorithm out-of-the-box. You would need to implement your own pathfinding algorithm (such as A* or Dijkstra) or use an external library/API to calculate the path, then use `flutter_map` to render the route. For simple indoor navigation in a parking lot, you can represent the parking grid as nodes, apply a pathfinding algorithm, and visualize the path on the map using `flutter_map`'s polyline functionality.

## recommend some packages of A star and Dijkstra


For implementing **A\*** or **Dijkstra's algorithm** in Dart, there are a few packages available that can simplify the process of setting up pathfinding algorithms. Here are some popular packages that you can use to implement graph-based algorithms like **A\*** or **Dijkstra**:

### 1. **`dart-graph`**
[`dart-graph`](https://pub.dev/packages/dart_graph) is a Dart package for graph theory, which includes support for building graphs, finding the shortest paths (using Dijkstra's algorithm), and more. While this package does not explicitly include A\*, you can implement it on top of the graph structures.

**Key Features:**
- Allows you to easily create graphs and add edges and nodes.
- Implements **Dijkstra's algorithm** to find the shortest path between nodes.

**Example Usage:**

```dart
import 'package:dart_graph/dart_graph.dart';

void main() {
  var graph = Graph<int>();

  // Add nodes (points in your parking lot, for example)
  graph.addNode(1);
  graph.addNode(2);
  graph.addNode(3);
  graph.addNode(4);

  // Add edges (connections between nodes)
  graph.addEdge(1, 2, 10); // Distance between node 1 and node 2 is 10
  graph.addEdge(2, 3, 15);
  graph.addEdge(3, 4, 5);
  graph.addEdge(1, 4, 50);

  // Find the shortest path from node 1 to node 4
  var shortestPath = graph.shortestPath(1, 4);
  print(shortestPath);  // Will print the shortest path (if exists)
}
```

While `dart-graph` directly supports **Dijkstra’s algorithm**, you would need to manually implement **A\*** if you need it, or adapt the package to use heuristics for pathfinding.

### 2. **`pathfinding`**
[`pathfinding`](https://pub.dev/packages/pathfinding) is a Dart package that implements the **A\*** pathfinding algorithm out-of-the-box. It can be used for both grid-based pathfinding (such as in a parking lot) and for general graph-based pathfinding.

**Key Features:**
- Implements **A\*** pathfinding algorithm.
- Works with grid-based layouts, which is perfect for indoor maps like parking lots.
- You can define custom heuristics for the A\* algorithm to suit your needs.

**Example Usage:**

```dart
import 'package:pathfinding/pathfinding.dart';

void main() {
  var grid = Grid(10, 10); // A 10x10 grid

  // Create a start and end point
  var start = Node(0, 0); // Starting at (0, 0)
  var end = Node(9, 9);   // Ending at (9, 9)

  // Set obstacles (e.g., parking spots blocked by columns)
  grid.setWalkableAt(5, 5, false); // Block (5, 5)

  // Apply A* algorithm to find the path
  var finder = AStarFinder();
  var path = finder.findPath(start.x, start.y, end.x, end.y, grid);

  print(path); // Prints the path from start to end, if one exists
}
```

This package provides a straightforward way to implement A\* pathfinding on a grid. You can modify the grid size and walkable areas as per your requirements.

### 3. **`dijkstra`**
[`dijkstra`](https://pub.dev/packages/dijkstra) is a simple Dart package that implements **Dijkstra’s algorithm** for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph.

**Key Features:**
- Implements **Dijkstra’s algorithm** for shortest path finding.
- Works with weighted graphs, so you can represent distances or other costs associated with edges.

**Example Usage:**

```dart
import 'package:dijkstra/dijkstra.dart';

void main() {
  // Create a map of nodes and edges with distances
  var graph = {
    'A': {'B': 1, 'C': 4},
    'B': {'A': 1, 'C': 2, 'D': 5},
    'C': {'A': 4, 'B': 2, 'D': 1},
    'D': {'B': 5, 'C': 1},
  };

  // Run Dijkstra's algorithm from 'A' to 'D'
  var result = dijkstra(graph, 'A', 'D');

  print(result); // Prints the shortest path and its distance
}
```

In this example:
- The graph is represented as a map, where each key is a node and the associated value is a map of adjacent nodes with their edge weights (distances).
- The `dijkstra` function finds the shortest path from the start node ('A') to the destination node ('D').

### 4. **`graphlib`**
[`graphlib`](https://pub.dev/packages/graphlib) is another graph library for Dart that can help in implementing **Dijkstra’s algorithm** and other graph algorithms. It provides a general-purpose graph structure with support for nodes, edges, and pathfinding algorithms.

**Key Features:**
- Provides a flexible graph structure for creating directed and undirected graphs.
- Allows the application of algorithms such as **Dijkstra** and **A\*** with some custom logic.

**Example Usage:**

```dart
import 'package:graphlib/graphlib.dart';

void main() {
  var g = Graph();

  // Add nodes and edges
  g.addNode('A');
  g.addNode('B');
  g.addNode('C');
  g.addEdge('A', 'B', 10);
  g.addEdge('B', 'C', 5);
  g.addEdge('A', 'C', 50);

  // Apply Dijkstra's algorithm
  var dijkstra = Dijkstra();
  var path = dijkstra.shortestPath(g, 'A', 'C');

  print(path); // Prints the shortest path from 'A' to 'C'
}
```

This package provides a graph abstraction where you can define nodes and edges, and then run algorithms like **Dijkstra** to compute the shortest path.

### Which Package to Choose?

- **For A\* Pathfinding**:
  - **`pathfinding`** is your best bet if you need A\* pathfinding on a grid-based map, like your indoor parking lot, as it is built specifically for A\* and provides grid-based functionality out of the box.

- **For Dijkstra's Algorithm**:
  - **`dart-graph`** and **`graphlib`** are solid choices for Dijkstra's algorithm. If you're working with a more general graph (not grid-based), these packages would be ideal.

- **For General Pathfinding**:
  - If you need more control and flexibility (e.g., if you're building a custom graph or pathfinding strategy), **`graphlib`** might be a better choice as it supports various graph algorithms and can be customized to fit your needs.

### Conclusion

If you're specifically looking for **A\*** or **Dijkstra’s algorithm** in your Flutter/Dart app for route planning within an indoor parking lot or similar environment, the best options are:

- **`pathfinding`** (for A\*) — great for grid-based pathfinding, perfect for things like indoor parking lots.
- **`dijkstra`** — straightforward Dijkstra implementation for general-purpose graph-based pathfinding.
- **`dart-graph`** — great for general graph-related tasks, including Dijkstra.
